# Data-science
There're some tasks,which i had been assigned for completing of Data science tasks.  There is 3 tasks.
TASK 1: Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner
        project with readily available data.
        The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket
        class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

TASK 2:MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON
        Build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors. You can use regression
        techniques to tackle this problem.
        The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model  
        that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or
        critics.
        Movie Rating Prediction project enables you to explore data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques. It provides insights into the 
        factors that influence movie ratings and allows you to build a model that
        can estimate the ratings of movies accuratel
