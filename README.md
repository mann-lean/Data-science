There're some tasks,which i had been assigned for completing of Data science tasks.  There is 3 tasks.

TASK 1: TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
        Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data.
        The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

TASK 2:MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON
        Build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors. You can use regression
        techniques to tackle this problem.
        The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics.
        Movie Rating Prediction project enables you to explore data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques. It provides insights into the 
        factors that influence movie ratings and allows you to build a model that can estimate the ratings of movies accuratelY.
TASK 3:
       The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements. Now, imagine that you have the 
measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species. Your objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers intotheir respective species
